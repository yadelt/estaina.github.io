   Type 2 Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects the way blood sugar is processed and it causes blood sugar
   levels to rise higher than they should be. People with Type 2 Diabetes are insulin resistant, meaning that
   their bodies doesn't use their insulin properly. Your pancreas make extra insulin to keep up and keep your blood
   sugar levels normal, but overtime, they eventually stop keeping up. Type 2 Diabetes is a chronic disease that is
   developed based on the types of food someone eats. It's most common within low-income communities of color that
   live in food deserts and suffer from food insecurity. This means that they live in communities that don't have
   grocery stores and fresh produce near them. When unhealthy food is inaccessible because of the distance, price, or
   lack of education; then people eat what the foods that are available to them. When you're surrounded by liquor stores
   that offer cheap and unhealthy foods that actually fit your budget, then you are most likely to eat that instead of
   the few produce options that are far overpriced. Low-income communities are predominantly of color and people of color
   develop Type 2 Diabetes the most. This demonstrates how people who already struggle have to dig themselves into a
   deeper hole and and once they develop diabetes, they continue to struggle more. Common treatments for diabetics are
   injecting themselves with insulin or taking metformin. These treatments carry prices that make it difficult to climb
   out of that hole, causing the cycle of poverty to coninue.
